## License rules

**NAScontrol** is provided under the terms of the CERN-OHL-S license version 2
as provided in the LICENSES/CERN-OHL-S-2.0 file.

Instead of adding license boilerplates to the individual files, **NAScontrol**
uses SPDX license identifiers, which are machine parseable and considered
legaly equivalent.

The SPDX license identifier in NAScontrol shall be added at the first possible
line in a file which can contain a comment. This is normally the first line
except for scripts. Scripts require the #!PATH_TO_INTERPRETER tag in the
first line; place the SPDX identifier into the second line.

The SPDX license identifier is added in form of a comment.
