## License rules

nascontrol-remote is provided under the terms of the CERN-OHL-S license
version 2 as provided in the LICENSES/CERN-OHL-S-2.0 file.

Instead of adding license boilerplates to the individual files,
nascontrol-remote uses SPDX license identifiers, which are machine parseable
and considered legaly equivalent.

The SPDX license identifier in nascontrol-remote shall be added at the first
possible line in a file which can contain a comment. This is normally the
first line except for scripts. Scripts require the #!PATH_TO_INTERPRETER tag
in the first line; place the SPDX identifier into the second line.

The SPDX license identifier is added in form of a comment.
